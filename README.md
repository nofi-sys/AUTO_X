# AI-Powered X Thread Composer

This application helps you compose and publish threads on X (formerly Twitter) directly from a desktop GUI. It features a powerful AI-driven tool to automatically split long-form text into a well-structured and engaging thread.

## Features

-   **Multiple Parsing Options**:
    -   **Manual Splitting**: Write your full text and the app will automatically split it by word count, or you can use double blank lines for manual breaks.
    -   **Plain-Thread Format**: Use a simple numeric format for pre-written threads.
    -   **âœ¨ AI-Powered Generation**: Leverage the power of OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently split your text into a coherent, ready-to-publish thread, complete with numbered tweets.
-   **Image Attachments**: Easily attach one image per tweet.
-   **Real-time Validation**: The UI provides instant feedback on character counts, preventing you from publishing tweets that are too long.
-   **Direct Publishing**: Post the entire thread to X with a single click.
