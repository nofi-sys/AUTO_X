# Code Review

This repository contains a Tkinter GUI that helps compose and publish threads to X (formerly Twitter). Below are some recommendations for improvement and a list of tasks to make the project more professional.

## Recommendations

1. Add a `README.md` explaining how to run the application, the required dependencies and how to set the necessary environment variables for the Twitter API.
2. Provide a `requirements.txt` file so users can easily install dependencies such as `tweepy`.
3. Move the Twitter credentials to a dedicated configuration module or class to avoid environment variable lookup scattered across the code.
4. Add docstrings for the `ThreadComposer` class and its methods, as well as for `split_text_into_tweets`, to document expected behavior.
5. Consider splitting the GUI logic from the posting logic so the latter can be unit tested independently of the Tkinter interface.
6. Use logging instead of message boxes for internal errors or debug output to aid troubleshooting.
7. Implement unit tests, especially for text splitting and any future non-GUI code, to help ensure stability as features are added.

## Task List

- [x] Create a `README.md` with clear setup and usage instructions.
- [x] Provide a `requirements.txt` listing external dependencies.
- [x] Refactor code to separate GUI components from API interactions.
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings across the codebase.
- [x] Integrate logging for errors and important events.
- [x] Write unit tests for utility functions and any refactored non-GUI logic.
